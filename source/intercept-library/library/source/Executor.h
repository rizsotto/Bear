     * This class implements the process execution logic.
     *
     * The caller of this is the POSIX interface for process creation.
     * This class encapsulate most of the logic and leave the C wrapper light
     * in order to test the functionality in unit tests.
     *
     * This is just a subset of all process creation calls.
     *
     * - Variable argument methods are not implemented. (The `execl*` methods.)
     *   Caller needs to convert those convenient functions by collecting the
     *   arguments into a C array.
     *
     * - Environment needs to pass for this methods. If a method does not have
     *   the environment explicitly passed as argument, it needs to grab it
     *   and pass to these methods.
