//! Semantic analysis module for command execution recognition and formatting.
//!
//! This module provides traits and types for recognizing the semantic meaning of executed commands
//! (such as compilers or interpreters) and for formatting their output into structured entries.
//!
//! # Main Components
//!
//! - [`Command`]: Enum representing recognized command types.
//! - [`Interpreter`]: Trait for recognizing the semantic meaning of an `Execution`.
//! - [`Formattable`]: Trait for converting recognized commands into output entries.
//! - [`FormatConfig`]: Configuration for formatting output entries.
//!
//! Implementors of [`Interpreter`] analyze an `Execution` and determine if it matches a known command.
//! If recognized, they return a boxed [`Command`] representing the semantic meaning of the execution.
//!
//! The [`Formattable`] trait allows recognized commands to be transformed into output entries (e.g.,
//! for a compilation database), using the provided [`FormatConfig`].
