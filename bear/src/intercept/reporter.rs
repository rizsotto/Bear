//! Reporter module for command interception layer.
//!
//! This module provides abstractions and implementations for reporting intercepted events
//! to a remote collector. It defines error types for initialization and reporting failures,
//! a trait for reporting events, and a factory for creating reporter instances.
//!
//! The main responsibilities include:
//! - Defining the `Reporter` trait for sending events.
//! - Providing error types for initialization and reporting.
//! - Implementing a factory to create TCP-based reporters.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Use `ReporterFactory::create()` to instantiate a reporter, or `ReporterFactory::create_as_ptr()`
//! to obtain a raw pointer suitable for static/global usage. The reporter sends events to a remote
//! collector, with the destination specified by the `KEY_DESTINATION` environment variable.
