/// A trait for consuming events from a channel-based stream.
///
/// # Type Parameters
/// - `T`: The type of items being consumed (typically `intercept::Event`)
/// - `E`: The error type that can occur during consumption
///
/// # Thread Safety
/// Implementors must be `Send + Sync` to allow usage across thread boundaries.
pub trait Consumer<T, E>: Send {
    /// Consumes all items from the receiver until the channel is closed.
    ///
    /// This is a blocking operation that processes each received item.
    /// The method returns when the sender side of the channel is dropped
    /// or when an error occurs during processing.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `receiver` - Channel receiver to consume items from
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// * `Ok(())` - All items were successfully processed
    /// * `Err(E)` - An error occurred during processing

/// - Build command execution (via `Executor`)
/// - Command interception (via `CancellableProducer`)
/// - Event processing (via `Consumer`)
///
/// The interceptor ensures proper coordination between these components,
/// handling thread synchronization and error propagation.
