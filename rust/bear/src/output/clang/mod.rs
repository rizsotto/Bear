//! This crate provides support for reading and writing JSON compilation database files.
//!
//! A compilation database is a set of records which describe the compilation of the
//! source files in a given project. It describes the compiler invocation command to
//! compile a source module to an object file.
//!
//! This database can have many forms. One well known and supported format is the JSON
//! compilation database, which is a simple JSON file having the list of compilation
//! as an array. The definition of the JSON compilation database files is done in the
//! LLVM project [documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html).
