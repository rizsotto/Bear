**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Environment:**
 - OS name: [e.g. linux] run `uname -s`
 - OS version: [e.g. CentOS 7.6] 
 - OS architecture: [e.g. `x86_64`] run `uname -m`
 - Bear version: [e.g. `3.15.0`]
 - Bear install method: [e.g. from package]

**Additional context**
 - Can you give us a reference to the project that you are running against this tool? [e.g. No if it's a close source project, but in case of an open source project a link to the sources could be nice.]
 - What build tools this project is using? [e.g. GNU make wtih `configure` script]
 - What architecture you are trying to compile for? [e.g. cross compiling]
 - Could you attach build logs? If you can re-run the command which failed (e.g. `bear -- make`) with extra verbose log switches (e.g. `bear --verbose -- make`) and send the output of it, that would help a lot.

**Before you send...**
 - Have you read the `README.md` file or `man bear`?
 - Have you looked what other open issues Bear has?
 - Are you sure that the build works without Bear?
